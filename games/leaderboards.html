    <h2 class="h2">INFORMATION: <br>Only the top 3 per game show on the leaderboards. For exmaple, more people than 3 have submitted a score for Slope, however only the top 3 scores are shown. The leaderboard gets updated every 1-2 days. To submit your own score, do up and click "Submit a score here". Then, fill out the form. In case you are wondering what the trophies next to the top winners are, they are rewards to getting a good score and submitting it. If you want to appear as anonymous, you can just make sure to say that in the form. You can get on the leaderboards for any game, even a game like 1v1.LOL. Anyways, lets get back to the trophie system. for 1st place in a game, you get 3 trophies. After you lose your spot in 1st place, you still have 3 trophies. I keep track of your trophies, dont worry about that. With the trophies, there is a shop (scroll down to see) and you can spend your trophies on different things, like a different launcher for example. The shop is still in work, but I am active and I am coming up with new ideas. If you have an idea for the site, feel free to tell me. If it is good enough, I might give you an extra trophie. Also, you can get trophies for any game, and considering that not even a fourth of the games are currently on the leaderboard, I recommend that you start taking screenshots of random games before other people do to maximize your amount of trophies. <br> <br> <br> SHOP: <br> 1🏆 - shoutout <br> 10🏆 - Custom launcher <br> 15🏆 - Custom site style <br> 10🏆 - Unlock a cheat menu for a game <br> MORE OPTIONS COMING SOON! <a href="shop.html" class="shopbtn">Buy an item here!</a> </h2><br><br>
